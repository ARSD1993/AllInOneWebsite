# AngularAllInOneWebsite

  This projects is meant to act as a personalized website were all information can be found in one place. At the current moment this site has two main features:

    1) A user todo list.

    2) An episode list for your favorite shows. A user can search for a series which will then show all episodes for that series. The user can then keep track of which episodes they have seen and which they still need to see.
  
  More feature will be added as the application grows.
  
# Todo

  1) Need to add data from a users favorite teams, favorite authors, stocks and sport scores.
  
  2) The Episode service is complete. Needs to be refactored a bit with add episode and update episode being very similar
  
  3) Entire site needs CSS or needs to look better but this well be done after all features are added.
